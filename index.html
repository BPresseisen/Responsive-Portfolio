        <p class="bio"> The embodiment of Sagittarius. The Prince of Pine Street. The President of !PLOT! I am a native Philadelphian, born and reared in Center City. Having lived in Chicago, New York City, Bombay, Tel Aviv, Beijing, Shanghai, and Tokyo, I can honestly say I enjoy traveling and learning new cultures. 
                        Music, sports, history, and the Arts are my passions. I also really enjoy a great sandwich. Currently, I live in Center City and work from home as a consultant where I also care for my Mom who has health issues but keeps a positive spirt and demonstrates what being brave and thankful means on a daily basis. <br> <br>   

                        I once entered and won a Seinfeld Jeopardy contest. The winnings included three days and two nights in NYC along with tickets to both an Orioles vs Yankees game and a Phillies vs Mets game. There was a Schnitzer's marble rye bread in my hotel room on arrival, along with a chocolate babka. I had lunch
                        at The Soup Man and dinner at Sardie's. The weekend even included a meal at Tom's Diner and a visit to the Aqueduct race track. <br> <br>
                    
                        Before I moved back to Philadelphia in June 2018, I went to the Barclay's Center in Brooklyn for the YO! MTV Raps 30th Anniversary Concert and saw legends from my favorite genre and music era perform. It was a great show to enjoy to attend on my way out of town. <br> <br>
                    
                        It's a blessing to be back in Philly, and I look forward to learning much in the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. It's been very challenging thus far, but I'm going to stick with it!</p>
